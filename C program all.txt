#include,#define,#error etc everything starts with # is a preprocessor directive it means they begin process before actual compliation

2
<stdio.h>,<string.h>,<stdlib.h> etc are library functions they are used to call standard library/built-in functions

stdio.h here .h means header file like .exe,.c file etc and stdio means standard input/output and the whole thing means standard i/O header file
3
semicolon used for ending a statement

double slash(//) is used for comments this comments are used for large programs mainly for the programmer to remember the part

/n is used for new line we can use it in the previous statement ending or we can use it in the beginning of new statement

/t is known as one tap means 2-3 space

normal space can be used as it is

keywords,string literals,identifiers,constant,symbol(&(ampercent)) this are c program made with

C is case sensitive

function is 2 types 1.user defined 2.built-in(printf)

we use () this bracket open/first bracket after function like main()

{} this bracket means curl/second bracket these are used for defining a function like we give it after main function its also known as body of program and when a compiler reaches the end of this bracket it gives return 0

IDE(Intregated Development Environment) made with 1.Code Editor 2.Compiler 3.Console 4.Debugger

Codeblocks
1.File~new~empty file(Ctrl+Shift+N shortcut) then save when saving make sure its on C/C++ file format
2.Use build and run button to compile
3.Can see problem in build messages

VS Code
1.new file save it as .c
2.to compile type in console gcc filename.c

keywords
These are the words that are reserved in c language we can't use it in any other form like if we use int it will work like integer in everywhere.There are 32 keywords in C 

1.auto 2.break 3.case 4.char 5.const 6.continue 7.default 8.do 9.double 10.else 11.enum 12.extern 13.float 14.for 15.while 16.goto
17.if 18.int 19.long 20.register 21.return 22.short 23.signed 24.sizeof 25.static 26.struct 27.switch 28.typedef 29.union 30.unsigned 31.void 32.volatile

data types

basic data type: int,char,float,double
derived data type:array,pointer,structure,union
enumeration data type: emum
void data type: void


Variables
variable is a memory location like we want to store a integer a in ram so we first specify the data type with int(data type) a(variable name); so we declared a integer which will assigned to a we can also set the value of a like int a=4 so we declared 4 is stored on a location here location means blocks of ram each type converts to bit to store like 0,1 




tomorrow 

identifiers are the things like variable names,function names by using which we can identify it

C doesn't allow characters like @,$ etc


variables are memory where we store data location name inside ram
variables has type like int,float,char
we store integer in int variable

study from ss tommorrow


identifiers,data type bit,ASCII convert in -o file,khata page,class task,home task,format specifier etc.
